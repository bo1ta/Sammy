/// A node in a hierarchical comment tree that wraps a `Comment` with additional tree-specific metadata.
///
/// `CommentNode` serves as the fundamental building block for organizing comments into a nested tree structure.
/// It implements `Identifiable` to enable SwiftUI list rendering and diffing.
///
/// ## Key Responsibilities:
/// 1. Wraps a `Comment` with tree-specific information (depth, children)
/// 2. Provides unique identification for SwiftUI rendering
/// 3. Maintains parent-child relationships between comments
///
struct CommentNode: Identifiable {
  /// The unique identifier matching the wrapped comment's ID
  var id: Int

  /// The actual comment content and metadata
  var comment: Comment

  /// Child comments in the reply hierarchy
  var children: [CommentNode]

  /// The nesting depth in the comment tree (0 for root comments)
  var depth: Int

  /// Creates a comment node from a base comment
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - comment: The base comment to wrap
  ///   - children: Immediate child/reply comments (default empty)
  ///   - depth: Nesting level in the hierarchy (default 0)
  ///
